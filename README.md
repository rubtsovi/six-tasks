In this readme I'd like to explain how run every solution;

### Task 1

In folder `task-01` you should firstly run `npm i` or `yarn` command. After that you should run dev server with command `npm run start` or build full project by running `npm run build`. Builded project will be generated in `dist` folder in which you should start an `http-server -c0` (please sure you installed this package globally, if not - run `npm i -g http-server`).

Terminal will tell you on which port you should open localhost in browser.

### Task 2

Just run script with `node duplicate.js` command.

### Task 3

Just run script with `node removeEven.js` command.

### Task 4

Run an `http-server -c0` in this folder and open your browser on address shown in the terminal.

### Task 5

Just run script with `node rename.js` command.

### Task 6

Run an `http-server -c0` in this folder and open your browser on address shown in the terminal.
